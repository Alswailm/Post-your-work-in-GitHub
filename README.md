### Udacity Programming For Data Science with Python Nanodegree
This repository contanins the projects we have cover on Udacity Programming For Data Science with Python Nanodegree

### First Project is "Investigate a Relational Database"
### Overview:
In this project, you will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. You will write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of your project submission, you will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of your queries.

We will begin by getting familiar with the database. We have included Practice Quizzes that include a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts taught throughout the SQL lessons. These practice quizzes will not be "graded" by a reviewer, but they will help you self-assess and make sure you are on the right track. The quizzes are there to assist you in understanding the database before developing the questions that you wish to include for the project.

The project submission is a presentation, which will be reviewed, and for which you will need to Meet Expectations to pass. For the presentation component, you will create four slides. Each slide will:

- Have a question of interest.
- Have a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question.
- Have a supporting visualization created using the final data of your SQL query that answers your question of interest.

You will submit your project at the end of the project lessons. Your project will include:

- A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
- A text file with your queries needed to answer each of the four questions.

The essentials of your project submission are discussed on the page labeled as Project Submission.


### Second Project is "Explore US Bikeshare Data"
### Overview:
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. You will write code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. You will also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Third Project is "Post Your Work on GitHub"
### Overview:
It's time to put what you've learned about version control and GitHub into practice! In this project, you'll be simulating a realistic workflow to refactor your previous BikeShare project using Git. Here's an overview of your tasks for this project.
